        <h2>Machines and Meows</h2>
        <p><strong>There once was a robot...</strong></p>
        <p>Who stood all alone</p>
        <p>Performing her duties from dusk until dawn</p>
        <p><em>Her machinery whirred<br> and her circutry hummed</em></p>
        <p>As she sorted the scraps <br> in the junkyard she worked</p>
        <p>But she stopped in her tracks</p>
        <p>When she heard a loud</p>
        <h3><strong><em>CRASH</em></strong></h3>
        <p>Her head spun<br> and her eyes scanned for the source</p>
        <p>Only to find a small orange cat</p>
        <p>The robot slowly approached</p>
        <p>And her new furry freind</p>
        <p><em>Meowed and purred</em></p>
        <p>As her hard metal hand<br> pet his soft fuzzy head</p>
        <p><strong>And from that day on...</strong></p>
        <p>They were best of freinds</p>
